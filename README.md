In this challenge I am working for a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called KryptoJobs2Go. KryptoJobs2Go is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As KryptoJobs2Goâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable our customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, I will complete the code that enables our customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I will assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

In this Challenge, we will:

Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

Digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.
